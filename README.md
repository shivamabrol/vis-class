#### vis-class
All the stuff for vis class
Projects/Assignments will be uploaded here


For class 2 what happened was I made all the svg changes in the file but as i was uploading it I deleted the file accidentally. 
However I can say that d3 and js have significant advantages over just using svg with html

1. Since I hardcoded the values in assignment 2 any small change would lead to a whole re-evaluation of the page since elements would overlap
2. Had to do a lot more lines of code as there was no way to use loops 
3. Difficult to maintain as all the values were manually calculated and the formula and calculations had to be done outside the code so in future unless the formula is mentioned in the code it's going to be difficult to explain and change
